- 😄 Pronouns: SHE/HER
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m the kind of woman who can debug a front-end layout and perfectly season a pot of jollof—sometimes in the same hour.
- By day, I’m building sleek, user-friendly interfaces and making sure no bug escapes me (QA instincts never sleep). By night, I’m either hosting friends like it’s a mini food festival or dreaming up the next digital solution that’ll change lives.
- I blend tech, tenderness, and a whole lot of spice—because why not?" 😄💻🍲✨
